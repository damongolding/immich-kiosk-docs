## Getting a person's ID from Immich
1. Open Immich's web interface and click on "Explore" in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click on the person you want the ID of (you may have to click "view all" if you don't see them).
3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/people/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
4. The persons ID is everything after `people/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.


## Person

The ID(s) of a specific person or people you want to display.

<Card title="Settings" icon="setting">
|         |                |
| ------- | -------------- |
| CONFIG  | `person`       |
| ENV     | `KIOSK_PERSON` |
| URL     | `person`       |
| VALUE   | `[]string`     |
| DEFAULT | `[]`           |

#### Using with config.yaml file

```yaml
person:
  - PERSON_ID
  - PERSON_ID
```

#### Using with ENV in your docker-compose file

 use a `,` to separate IDs

```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_PERSON: "PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID"
```

#### Using with url queries

```http
http://{URL}?person=PERSON_ID&person=PERSON_ID&person=PERSON_ID
```
</Card>


### How multiple people work
When you specify multiple people and/or albums, Immich Kiosk creates a pool of all the requested album and person IDs.
For each image refresh, Kiosk randomly selects one ID from this pool and fetches an image associated with that person or album.

## Require All People

The `require_all_people` feature allows you to filter images to only show those where all specified people are present together in the same photo.

<Card title="Settings" icon="setting">
    |         |                            |
    | ------- | -------------------------- |
    | CONFIG  | `require_all_people`       |
    | ENV     | `KIOSK_REQUIRE_ALL_PEOPLE` |
    | URL     | `require_all_people`       |
    | VALUE   | `bool`                     |
    | DEFAULT | `false`                    |

#### Using with config.yaml file

```yaml
require_all_people: true
```

#### Using with ENV in your docker-compose file

```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_REQUIRE_ALL_PEOPLE: true
```

#### Using with url queries

```http
http://{URL}?require_all_people=true
```
</Card>

### How It Works

When enabled:
- Only photos containing ALL specified people will be displayed
- Photos where only some of the specified people appear will be excluded

### Example Use Cases

1. **Family Photos**:
   - Set multiple person IDs for family members
   - Enable `require_all_people` to only show assets where the whole family is together

2. **Group Events**:
   - Specify IDs for members of a group
   - See only photos where everyone was present

### Important Notes

<Aside type="note">
- This setting only takes effect when multiple people are specified
- If no matching photos are found (where all people appear together), Kiosk will display an error message
- This feature **cannot** be combined with other source/buckets like date ranges or albums
- Setting to `false` returns to default behavior where photos containing ANY of the specified people will be shown

## Excluded People

<Aside type="caution">
    The person or people you want to exclude from the slideshow must be tagged for the exclusion to work.
</Aside>

This feature allows you to prevent specific people from being displayed in the slideshow.

<Card title="Settings" icon="setting">
    |         |                         |
    | ------- | ----------------------- |
    | CONFIG  | `excluded_people`       |
    | ENV     | `KIOSK_EXCLUDED_PEOPLE` |
    | URL     | `exclude_person`        |
    | VALUE   | `[]string`              |
    | DEFAULT | `[]`                    |

#### Using with config.yaml file

```yaml
excluded_people:
  - PERSON_ID
  - PERSON_ID
```

#### Using with ENV in your docker-compose file

 use a `,` to separate IDs

```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_EXCLUDED_PEOPLE: "PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID"
```

#### Using with url queries

Note it is `exclude_person=` and not `excluded_people=` in the url.

```http
http://{URL}?exclude_person=PERSON_ID&exclude_person=PERSON_ID&exclude_person=PERSON_ID
```
</Card>

<Aside type="tip">
    You can remove all excluded people settings (from your `config.yaml` or environment variables) by using `none` in the URL query parameters.

    Example:
    ```http
    https://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID&exclude_person=none
    ```
</Aside>
