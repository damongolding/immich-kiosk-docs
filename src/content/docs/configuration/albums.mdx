## Getting an albums ID from Immich
1. Open Immich's web interface and click on "Albums" in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click on the album you want the ID of.
3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/albums/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
4. The album ID is everything after `albums/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.

## Albums

The ID(s) of a specific album or albums you want to display.

<Settings
    config="albums"
    env="KIOSK_ALBUMS"
    url="album"
    value="[]string"
    defaultValue="[]"
    configOver={`albums:
    - ALBUM_ID
    - ALBUM_ID
    `}
    envOver={`environment:
    KIOSK_ALBUMS: "ALBUM_ID, ALBUM_ID"
    `}
    urlOver={"http://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID"}
/>


## Exclude albums

This feature allows you to prevent specific album assets from being displayed in the slideshow.

<Aside type="note">
Excluded albums take precedence over album selection methods. If an album is in both the selected albums and excluded albums lists, it will be excluded.
</Aside>

<Settings
    config="excluded_albums"
    env="KIOSK_EXCLUDED_ALBUMS"
    url="exclude_album"
    value="[]string"
    defaultValue="[]"
    configOver={`excluded_albums:
    - ALBUM_ID
    - ALBUM_ID
    `}
    envOver={`environment:
    KIOSK_EXCLUDED_ALBUMS: "ALBUM_ID, ALBUM_ID"
    `}
    urlOver={"http://{URL}?exclude_album=ALBUM_ID"}
/>

<Aside type="tip">
You can remove excluded albums that were previously set in your `config.yaml` or environment variables by using `none` in the URL query parameters.

Example:
```http
https://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID&exclude_album=none
```
</Aside>

## Album Order

<Aside type="note">
- When using multiple albums, the order of the albums is random.
- When using splitview layouts:
  - Kiosk will look for a second image with matching orientation
  - The second image shown may not be the next sequential image
  - Priority is given to finding images with the right aspect ratio for a balanced display
</Aside>

This controls the order in which the assets from the selected album(s) are displayed.

<Settings
    config="album_order"
    env="KIOSK_ALBUM_ORDER"
    url="album_order"
    value="random | newest | oldest"
    defaultValue="random"
/>
