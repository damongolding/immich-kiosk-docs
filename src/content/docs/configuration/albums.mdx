## Getting an albums ID from Immich
1. Open Immich's web interface and click on "Albums" in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click on the album you want the ID of.
3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/albums/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
4. The album ID is everything after `albums/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.

## Albums

The ID(s) of a specific album or albums you want to display.

<Settings
    config="albums"
    env="KIOSK_ALBUMS"
    url="album"
    value="[]string"
    defaultValue="[]"
    configOver={`albums:
    - ALBUM_ID
    - ALBUM_ID
    `}
    envOver={`environment:
    KIOSK_ALBUMS: "ALBUM_ID, ALBUM_ID"
    `}
    urlOver={"http://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID"}
/>


## Exclude albums

This feature allows you to prevent specific album assets from being displayed in the slideshow.

<Aside type="note">
Excluded albums take precedence over album selection methods. If an album is in both the selected albums and excluded albums lists, it will be excluded.
</Aside>

<Settings
    config="excluded_albums"
    env="KIOSK_EXCLUDED_ALBUMS"
    url="excluded_albums"
    value="[]string"
    defaultValue="[]"
    configOver={`excluded_albums:
    - ALBUM_ID
    - ALBUM_ID
    `}
    envOver={`environment:
    KIOSK_ALBUM: "ALBUM_ID, ALBUM_ID"
    `}
    urlOver={"http://{URL}?excluded_albums=ALBUM_ID"}
/>

<Aside type="tip">
You can remove excluded albums that were previously set in your `config.yaml` or environment variables by using `none` in the URL query parameters.

Example:
```http
https://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID&exclude_album=none
```
</Aside>

## Album Order

<Aside type="note">
- When using multiple albums, the order of the albums is random.
- When using splitview layouts:
  - Kiosk will look for a second image with matching orientation
  - The second image shown may not be the next sequential image
  - Priority is given to finding images with the right aspect ratio for a balanced display
</Aside>

This controls the order in which the assets from the selected album(s) are displayed.

<Settings
    config="album_order"
    env="KIOSK_ALBUM_ORDER"
    url="album_order"
    value="random | newest | oldest"
    defaultValue="random"
/>

## Album Video

<Aside type="caution">
This feature only supports album videos with certain limitations:
- Videos will autoplay with audio muted
- the `album_video` setting must be enabled
- the `prefetch` setting must be enabled
- Browser codec support may vary
</Aside>

<Settings
    config="album_video"
    env="KIOSK_ALBUM_VIDEO"
    url="album_video"
    value="bool"
    defaultValue="false"
/>


### Video Optimization Recommendations

For optimal playback performance, it's strongly recommended to transcode your videos. This can be configured in Immich:
```
Admin Panel -> System Settings -> Video Transcoding
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- Codec: H264 (for maximum browser compatibility)
- Target Resolution: Select the lowest acceptable resolution for your needs

### How Video Playback Works

1. **Video Selection Process:**
   - When Kiosk selects a video from an album, it first checks if the video is cached.
   - Videos are temporarily stored in the operating system's temp directory.
   - If not cached, the video downloads in the background while another asset is displayed.

2. **Cache Management:**
   - Downloaded videos are queued for display once ready.
   - Cached videos are automatically removed after 10 minutes of inactivity to conserve disk space.
   - Videos are automatically removed when Kiosk shuts down.

3. **Playback Handling:**
   Kiosk will skip to the next asset if any of these conditions occur:
   - Video codec is unsupported by the browser
   - Playback doesn't start within 5 seconds
   - Video playback completes
   - Any playback errors are detected

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your videos are transcoded to H264 format.
- Check browser compatibility with your video codecs.
- Verify that `prefetch` is enabled in your configuration.
- Monitor system storage for cached video files.
