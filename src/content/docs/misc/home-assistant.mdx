<Aside type="note">
 These examples are community Kiosk implementations.
 I am unable to provide support for Home Assistant via issues.
</Aside>

While I did not create Kiosk with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) in mind. I thought it would be useful to add Kiosk implementations I have come across.

## Using Kiosk to add a slideshow in Home Assistant.

<Steps>
1. Open up the dahsboard you want to add the slideshow to in edit mode.

2. Hit "add card" and search "webpage".

3. Enter the your Immich Kiosk url in the URL field e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000`

4. If you want to have some specific settings for the slideshow you can add them to the *[URL](#changing-settings-via-url)
</Steps>

\* I would suggest disabling all the UI i.e. `http://192.168.0.123:3000?disable_ui=true`

## Using Kiosk to set Immich images as Home Assistant dashboard background

<Aside type="note">
    You can find more documentation on the `/image` endpoint [here](/misc/image/)
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the dashboard with the view you wish to add the image background to.

2. Enter edit mode and click the ‚úè next to the view you want to add the image to.

3. Select the "background" tab and toggle on "Local path or web URL" and enter your url* with path /image e.g. http://192.168.0.123:3000/image.
</Steps>

\* If you want to specify an album or a person you can also add that to the url e.g. http://192.168.0.123:3000/image?album=ALBUM_ID

## Using Immich Kiosk as an image source for Wallpanel in Home Assistant:

<Aside type="tip">
 The new version of wallpanel doesn't seem to grab new images if the url is not dynamic.
 Adding a wallpanel varqaible to the Kiosk url fixes this.
 An example is adding `t=${timestamp}` the url.
 Kiosk does not need or use this data but fixes the issue in newer Wallpanel versions.
</Aside>

```yaml
  wallpanel:
    enabled: true
    image_fit: cover
    idle_time: 10
    screensaver_entity: input_boolean.kiosk
    screensaver_stop_navigation_path: /dashboard-kiosk
    fullscreen: true
    display_time: 86400
    image_url: >-
      http://{immich-kiosk-url}/image?person=PERSON_1_ID&person=PERSON_2_ID&t=${timestamp}
    cards:
      - type: vertical-stack
        cards:
          - type: custom:weather-card
            details: true
            forecast: true
            hourly_forecast: false
            name: Weather
            entity: weather.pirateweather
            current: true
            number_of_forecasts: '6'
          - type: custom:horizon-card
            darkMode: true
            showAzimuth: true
            showElevation: true
```
