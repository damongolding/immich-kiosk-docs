## Fully Kiosk browser

If you are using Kiosk with the [Fully Kiosk Browser](https://www.fully-kiosk.com/) (Pro version), you can take advantage of additional features. For example, setting `sleep_dim_screen=true` will automatically dim the screen when the device enters sleep mode.

## ImmichFrame app

Although Kiosk doesn't have its own dedicated mobile app, the ImmichFrame team has developed a native Android application that's compatible with Kiosk. The app offers two key advantages:

1. Better performance through a lightweight WebView implementation (compared to running in a full browser)
2. The ability to use Kiosk as your Android device's screensaver

To get started, visit the ImmichFrame documentation. After installing the app, simply launch it and enter your Kiosk URL to begin using the service.
