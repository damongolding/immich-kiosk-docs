This controls how the image will fit on your screen

<Settings
  config="image_fit"
  env="KIOSK_IMAGE_FIT"
  url="image_fit"
  value="contain | cover | none"
  defaultValue="contain"
/>


## Options

### Contain (the default)
The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit the whole screen. If the image is smaller than your screen, there will be some fuzzyness to your image.

### Cover
The image will cover the whole screen. To achieve this the image will mostly likely have some clipping/cropping and if the image is smaller than your screen, there will be some fuzzyness to your image.

### None
The image is centered and displayed "as is". If the image is larger than your screen it will be scaled down to fit your screen.
