    If you plan to add iframes to untrusted or external content, be aware of security implications.

    Only load content from trusted sources that you control.
</Aside>

If you want to display custom content in Kiosk, you can use iframes.

<Settings
    config="iframe"
    env="KIOSK_IFRAME"
    url="N/A"
    value="[]string"
    configOver={`iframe:
    - https://example.com
    - ./weather.html  # Local file in same directory
    - ./content/dashboard.html  # Local file in subdirectory
    `}
    envOver={`environment:
    KIOSK_IFRAME: "https://example.com, ./weather.html, ./content/dashboard.html"
    `}
/>


## Adding iframes to Kiosk

You can configure Kiosk to display external or local HTML content using iframes. This can be set in your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
iframe: "https://example.com"  # Remote URL
```

For local files, they must be `.html` files and at the same level or in a subdirectory of the Kiosk application:

<Aside type="tip">
  If using docker you will need to mount local files into the container.
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./weather.html:/weather.html
    - ./content/dashboard.html:/content/dashboard.html
  ```
</Aside>

```yaml
iframe:
  - "./weather.html"  # Local file in same directory
  - "./content/dashboard.html"  # Local file in subdirectory
```
