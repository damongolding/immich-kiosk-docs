<Aside type="note">
    Frameo devices tend to be low powered devices with limited resources. It is recommended to disable any [image effects](/configuration/image-effects/) and depending on your device's capabilities you may need to enable [optimize_images](/configuration/behavior/#optimize-images).
</Aside>

If you have a Frameo frame device and want to use Kiosk on it, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

- Have [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) downloaded/installed.
- Have ADB Access enabled in the Frameo `Settings->About->Enable Beta Program.`
- (Might need) USB-C to USB-A cable to connect your frameo frame to your computer.
    - Some frames do not have tcpip enabled on the frame by default so a USB connection might be needed.

## Connecting to the Frameo Frame through USB

<Aside type="tip">
    Some Frameo frames only allow ONE device to connect to it. Otherwise, this process needs to be done by each device connecting to the frame.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
    Once rebooted, the device will lose these settings. In order to keep the settings and enable connecting remotely, you will need to use a program like Tasker to restore ADB each reboot.
</Aside>

<Steps>

    1. Connect USB-C cable from the Frameo Frame to computer through a USB-A port

    2. On the computer list devices
    ```sh
       adb devices
    ```

   3. If the list of devices has `Unauthorized` next to it then you will need to go to `Settings->About->Enable Beta Program.` and toggle it back and forth

        a. A reboot might be needed as well

   4. The list of devices should show `device` next to the frame that is attached via USB. If that isn't the case, then go back to step 3.

   5. Enable tcpip on the frame
   ```sh
      adb tcpip 55555
   ```

   6. You can now continue with the steps below
