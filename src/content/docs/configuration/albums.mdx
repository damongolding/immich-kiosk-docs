## Getting an albums ID from Immich
1. Open Immich's web interface and click on "Albums" in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click on the album you want the ID of.
3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/albums/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
4. The album ID is everything after `albums/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.

## Album

The ID(s) of a specific album or albums you want to display.

<Settings
    config="album"
    env="KIOSK_ALBUM"
    url="album"
    value="[]string"
    defaultValue="[]"
    configOver={`album:
    - ALBUM_ID
    - ALBUM_ID
    `}
    envOver={`environment:
    KIOSK_ALBUM: "ALBUM_ID, ALBUM_ID"
    `}
    urlOver={"http://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID"}
/>


### How multiple albums work
When you specify multiple albums and/or people, Immich Kiosk creates a pool of all the requested person and album IDs.
For each image refresh, Kiosk randomly selects one ID from this pool and fetches an image associated with that album or person.


## Exclude albums

This feature allows you to prevent specific album assets from being displayed in the slideshow.

<Aside type="note">
Excluded albums take precedence over album selection methods. If an album is in both the selected albums and excluded albums lists, it will be excluded.
</Aside>

<Settings
    config="excluded_albums"
    env="KIOSK_EXCLUDED_ALBUMS"
    url="excluded_albums"
    value="[]string"
    defaultValue="[]"
    configOver={`excluded_albums:
    - ALBUM_ID
    - ALBUM_ID
    `}
    envOver={`environment:
    KIOSK_ALBUM: "ALBUM_ID, ALBUM_ID"
    `}
    urlOver={"http://{URL}?excluded_albums=ALBUM_ID"}
/>

<Aside type="tip">
You can remove excluded albums that were previously set in your `config.yaml` or environment variables by using `none` in the URL query parameters.

Example:
```http
https://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID&exclude_album=none
```
</Aside>

## Album Order

<Aside type="note">
- When using multiple albums, the order of the albums is random.
- When using splitview layouts:
  - Kiosk will look for a second image with matching orientation
  - The second image shown may not be the next sequential image
  - Priority is given to finding images with the right aspect ratio for a balanced display
</Aside>

This controls the order in which the assets from the selected album(s) are displayed.

<Settings
    config="album_order"
    env="KIOSK_ALBUM_ORDER"
    url="album_order"
    value="random | newest | oldest"
    defaultValue="random"
/>

## Experimental Album Video Support

<Aside type="caution">
This feature is experimental and currently only supports album videos with certain limitations:
- Videos will autoplay with audio muted
- the `experimental_album_video` [configuration](#configuration) setting must be enabled
- the `prefetch` [configuration](#configuration) setting must be enabled
- Browser codec support may vary
</Aside>

<Settings
    config="experimental_album_video"
    env="KIOSK_EXPERIMENTAL_ALBUM_VIDEO"
    url="experimental_album_video"
    value="bool"
    defaultValue="false"
/>


### Video Optimization Recommendations

For optimal playback performance, it's strongly recommended to transcode your videos. This can be configured in Immich:
```
Admin Panel -> System Settings -> Video Transcoding
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- Codec: H264 (for maximum browser compatibility)
- Target Resolution: Select the lowest acceptable resolution for your needs

### How Video Playback Works

1. **Video Selection Process:**
   - When Kiosk selects a video from an album, it first checks if the video is cached.
   - Videos are temporarily stored in the operating system's temp directory.
   - If not cached, the video downloads in the background while another asset is displayed.

2. **Cache Management:**
   - Downloaded videos are queued for display once ready.
   - Cached videos are automatically removed after 10 minutes of inactivity to conserve disk space.
   - Videos are automatically removed when Kiosk shuts down.

3. **Playback Handling:**
   Kiosk will skip to the next asset if any of these conditions occur:
   - Video codec is unsupported by the browser
   - Playback doesn't start within 5 seconds
   - Video playback completes
   - Any playback errors are detected

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your videos are transcoded to H264 format.
- Check browser compatibility with your video codecs.
- Verify that `prefetch` is enabled in your configuration.
- Monitor system storage for cached video files.
