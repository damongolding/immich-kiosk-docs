   ## Can I use this to set Immich images as my Home Assistant dashboard background?

    Yes! Just navigate to the dashboard with the view you wish to add the image background to.

    Enter edit mode and click the <Icon name="pencil" class="inline" /> next to the view you want to add the image to.

    Then select the "background" tab and toggle on "Local path or web URL" and enter your url with path `/image` e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000/image`.

    If you want to specify an album or a person you can also add that to the url e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000/image?album=ALBUM_ID`
