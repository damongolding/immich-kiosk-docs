The same constraints/recomendations apply to Live Photos as they do to [album videos](/configuration/albums/#album-video).

Some cameras can capture a few seconds of video just before or after you take a photoâ€”these are called Live Photos. When you upload Live Photos to Immich, the photo and video are saved as separate files. If Live Photos are enabled, Kiosk will first show the still image while the video loads in the background. Once the video is ready, it will play in a loop.

## Live Photos

<Settings
