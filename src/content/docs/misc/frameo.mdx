<Aside type="note">
    **Not all Frameo devices are equal!** Newer models like the **ZN-DP1101** offer significantly better performance and easier installation. See the [Model Compatibility](#model-compatibility) section below for recommendations before purchasing or installing.
</Aside>

## Model Compatibility

<Aside type="tip" title="Recommended Device">
    **ZN-DP1101** - This newer Frameo model is highly recommended for Kiosk. It features Android 13, modern WebView (v101+), excellent performance, and requires **no root access** or WebView updates. Installation is quick and straightforward.
</Aside>

### Tested Devices

| Model | Android | Firmware | WebView | Root Required | WebView Update | Performance |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **ZN-DP1101** | 13 | BND-A133-1101-20241127 | v101.0.4951.61 | ❌ No | ❌ Not needed | Excellent |
| Older models | <13 | Various | v80-v100 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Required | Limited |

### Quick Start for ZN-DP1101

If you have the **ZN-DP1101** model, you can follow this simplified installation path:

<Steps>
    1. **Configure WiFi** using Android system settings (not just the Frameo wizard), as the Frameo app WiFi settings won't work when disabled
    2. Enable ADB in `Settings -> About -> Enable Beta Program`
    3. Connect via USB or enable ADB over TCP/IP
    4. **Make ADB persistent** (survives reboots)
    5. **Skip the WebView update section** (already compatible!)
    6. Install ImmichFrame APK via ADB
    7. Configure your Kiosk server URL
    8. Set ImmichFrame as default launcher and disable Frameo app
    9. Done!

Total time: ~10 minutes
</Steps>

See the [ImmichFrame installation](#displaying-kiosk-on-your-frameo) section below for detailed commands.

---

## General Installation Guide

The following sections provide detailed instructions for all Frameo devices. If you have a **ZN-DP1101**, you can skip the WebView update section.

## Prerequisites

- Have [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) downloaded/installed.
- Have ADB Access enabled in the Frameo `Settings->About->Enable Beta Program.`
- (Might need) USB-C to USB-A cable to connect your frameo frame to your computer.
    - Some frames do not have tcpip enabled on the frame by default so a USB connection might be needed.

<Aside type="tip" title="Accessing Android System Settings">
    Throughout this guide, you'll need to access Android system settings. Here are the available methods:
    - **From ImmichFrame** (after installation): Swipe down from the top of the screen within the ImmichFrame app, then select "Launch Android Settings"
    - **From Frameo app**: Swipe down from the top to open quick settings, then tap the gear icon
    - **Via ADB**: Use commands like `adb shell am start -a android.settings.SETTINGS` or `adb shell am start -a android.settings.WIFI_SETTINGS`
</Aside>

## Important Pre-Installation Steps

<Aside type="caution">
    Complete these steps **before** disabling the Frameo app to ensure your device stays connected.
</Aside>

### Configure WiFi in Android Settings

<Aside type="caution" title="Critical Step">
    The Frameo setup wizard only configures WiFi within the Frameo app. When you disable the Frameo app, these settings won't work and your device will lose connectivity. You **must** configure WiFi in Android system settings.
</Aside>

<Steps>
    1. On the Frameo device, access Android settings using **one of these methods**:
       - **From ImmichFrame** (if already installed): Swipe down from the top within the ImmichFrame app, then select "Launch Android Settings"
       - **From Frameo app**: Swipe down from the top to access quick settings, then tap the gear icon
       - **Via ADB**: `adb shell am start -a android.settings.WIFI_SETTINGS`

    2. Navigate to `Network & Internet` or `WiFi`

    3. Connect to your WiFi network using the Android WiFi settings (not the Frameo app)

    4. Verify the connection is established
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
    **Accessing Android Settings from ImmichFrame**: Once ImmichFrame is installed, you can easily access Android system settings by swiping down from the top of the screen while in the ImmichFrame app and selecting "Launch Android Settings". This is the quickest way to access settings after setup.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
    After configuring WiFi in Android settings, your device will maintain connectivity even when the Frameo app is disabled.
</Aside>

## Connecting to the Frameo Frame with ADB

You have two options for connecting to your Frameo device via ADB: **USB (wired)** or **Network (wireless)**. Choose the method that works best for you.

### Option 1: USB Connection (Recommended for Setup)

<Aside type="tip">
    USB connection is more reliable for initial setup and doesn't require knowing the device's IP address.
</Aside>

<Steps>
    1. Connect USB-C cable from the Frameo Frame to your computer
    2. Verify the connection:
        ```sh
        adb devices
        ```
        You should see your device listed (e.g., `2c000c64a6c0c7d21dd device`)
    3. If the list shows `unauthorized`:
        - Go to `Settings -> About -> Enable Beta Program` on the device
        - Toggle it off and back on
        - Accept the authorization prompt on the device screen
    4. Verify the device now shows as `device` (not `unauthorized`)
</Steps>

**All commands below work with USB connection** - no need to change them, just run as-is.

### Making ADB Persistent (Highly Recommended)

<Aside type="tip" title="Critical: Never Need Frameo App Again">
    By default, ADB authorization resets after rebooting, which would require you to **re-enable the Frameo app** to access settings and toggle Beta Program again. This fix makes ADB persist permanently across reboots, **eliminating any need to ever enable the Frameo app again**.
</Aside>

Once you have ADB connected and authorized, run these commands to make it persistent:

```sh
# Set persistent USB configuration for ADB
adb shell "setprop persist.sys.usb.config adb"

# Ensure ADB and developer settings stay enabled
adb shell "settings put global adb_enabled 1"
adb shell "settings put global development_settings_enabled 1"
```

**Verify it worked:**
```sh
adb shell getprop persist.sys.usb.config
```
Should output: `adb`

**Test after reboot:**
```sh
adb reboot
# Wait for device to fully boot (30-60 seconds)
adb devices
```

Your device should now show as `device` (not `unauthorized`) without needing to toggle Beta Program!

### Option 2: Network Connection (Wireless)

<Aside type="caution">
    Network ADB resets after reboot. You'll need to re-enable it via USB after each restart, or use tools like Tasker to automate this.
</Aside>

<Steps>
    1. First, connect via USB (see Option 1 above)
    2. Enable ADB over network:
        ```sh
        adb tcpip 55555
        ```
    3. Find your device's IP address:
        ```sh
        adb shell ip addr show wlan0 | grep "inet "
        ```
        Or check in Android Settings under `Network & Internet -> WiFi`
    4. Disconnect USB cable
    5. Connect via network:
        ```sh
        adb connect <device_ip>:55555
        ```
        Example: `adb connect 192.168.1.100:55555`
    6. Verify connection:
        ```sh
        adb devices
        ```
</Steps>

**When using network ADB:** Replace commands throughout this guide that start with `adb` with the network connection first. For example:
```sh
# If using network ADB, connect first:
adb connect 192.168.1.100:55555

# Then run your command:
adb install ImmichFrame_v48.apk
```

## Updating the system WebView

<Aside type="tip">
    **Check WebView version first**: Before attempting to update WebView, verify your current version:
    ```sh
    adb shell dumpsys webviewupdate
    ```
    If you see **WebView v101 or newer**, you can skip this entire section - your device is already compatible with Kiosk.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
    Not all Frameo devices are the same and hardware and software versions may differ, and these instructions may not work for every device. Proceed at your own risk. We accept no responsibility for any damage or issues that may result from following these steps.

<Aside type="tip">
    The location of the WebView APK may vary depending on your device or Android version. To find its path, use:
    ```sh
    adb shell pm path com.android.webview
    ```
</Aside>

**Older** Frameo frame devices normally come with a very old system WebView that is not compatible with Kiosk. To update the WebView, follow these steps:

<Steps>

    1. Download the 106 WebView apk from [here](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/lineageos/android-system-webview-2/android-system-webview-2-106-0-5249-126-release/android-system-webview-106-0-5249-126-12-android-apk-download/)

    2. Connect to your device with ADB (see [connection options](#connecting-to-the-frameo-frame-with-adb) above - USB or network)

    3. Push the WebView apk to the device
       ```sh
       adb push path/to/downloaded/webview.apk /sdcard/
       ```
    4. Enter root
       ```sh
       adb shell su
       ```

    5. Backup the original WebView apk
       ```sh
       mount -o remount,rw /system && cp /system/app/webview/webview.apk /system/app/webview/webview.apk.bak
       ```

    6. Remove the existing WebView oat files
       ```sh
       mount -o remount,rw /system && rm -rf /system/app/webview/oat
       ```

    7. Copy the new WebView apk to the device
       ```sh
       mount -o remount,rw /system && cp /sdcard/webview.apk /system/app/webview/webview.apk
       ```

    8. Exit root
       ```sh
       exit
       ```

    9. Reboot the device
        ```sh
        adb reboot
        ```

## Troubleshooting

### Device Loses WiFi Connection After Disabling Frameo App

<Aside type="caution">
    This is the most common issue! The Frameo wizard only configures WiFi within the Frameo app, not in Android system settings.
</Aside>

**Solution:**

<Steps>
    1. Re-enable the Frameo app temporarily:
       ```sh
       adb shell pm enable net.frameo.frame
       ```

    2. Access Android WiFi settings on the device using **one of these methods**:
       - **From ImmichFrame**: Swipe down from the top within the ImmichFrame app, select "Launch Android Settings"
       - **From Frameo app**: Swipe down from the top, tap the gear icon for Settings
       - Then navigate to `Network & Internet -> WiFi`

    3. Connect to your WiFi network in Android settings (not Frameo app)

    4. Verify connection is working

    5. Disable the Frameo app again:
       ```sh
       adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 net.frameo.frame
       ```
</Steps>

### ImmichFrame Not Starting on Boot

Verify ImmichFrame is set as the default home launcher:

```sh
adb shell cmd package set-home-activity com.immichframe.immichframe/.MainActivity
```

Test by simulating a home button press:

```sh
adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_HOME
```

### ADB Connection Issues

If you see "unauthorized" when connecting:

<Steps>
    1. On the Frameo device, go to `Settings -> About -> Enable Beta Program`
    2. Toggle it off and back on
    3. Accept the authorization prompt on the device screen
    4. Try connecting again: `adb devices`
    5. **Make ADB persistent** to avoid this issue after reboots - see [Making ADB Persistent](#making-adb-persistent-highly-recommended) section
</Steps>

### Re-enable Frameo App (Restore Original Functionality)

If you need to restore the original Frameo functionality:

```sh
# Re-enable the Frameo app
adb shell pm enable net.frameo.frame

# Set it as default launcher
adb shell cmd package set-home-activity net.frameo.frame/.MainActivity

# (Optional) Uninstall ImmichFrame
adb uninstall com.immichframe.immichframe
```
