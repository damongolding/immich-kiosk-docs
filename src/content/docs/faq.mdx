   ## Can I use this to set Immich images as my Home Assistant dashboard background?

    Yes! Just navigate to the dashboard with the view you wish to add the image background to.

    Enter edit mode and click the <Icon name="pencil" class="inline" /> next to the view you want to add the image to.

    Then select the "background" tab and toggle on "Local path or web URL" and enter your url with path `/image` e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000/image`.

    If you want to specify an album or a person you can also add that to the url e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000/image?album=ALBUM_ID`

<FAQ>
## How do I set/use a password?
<Aside type="caution">
 This feature is meant for edgecase scenarios and offers very little in terms of protection.
 If you are aiming to expose Kiosk beyond your local network, please investigate more secure alternatives.
</Aside>

via config.yaml file
```yaml
kiosk:
  password: 12345
```

via ENV in your docker-compose file
```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_PASSWORD: "12345"
```

Then to access Kiosk you MUST add the password param in your URL e.g. `http://{URL}?password=12345`
