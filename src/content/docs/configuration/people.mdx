## Getting a person's ID from Immich
1. Open Immich's web interface and click on "Explore" in the left-hand navigation.
2. Click on the person you want the ID of (you may have to click "view all" if you don't see them).
3. The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/people/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
4. The persons ID is everything after `people/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.


## People

The ID(s) of a specific person or people you want to display.

<Settings
    config="people"
    env="KIOSK_PEOPLE"
    url="person"
    value="[]string"
    defaultValue="[]"
    configOver={`people:
    - PERSON_ID
    - PERSON_ID
    `}
    envOver={`environment:
    KIOSK_PEOPLE: "PERSON_ID, PERSON_ID"
    `}
    urlOver={"http://{URL}?person=PERSON_ID"}
/>

## Require All People

The `require_all_people` feature allows you to filter images to only show those where all specified people are present together in the same photo.

<Settings
    config="require_all_people"
    env="KIOSK_REQUIRE_ALL_PEOPLE"
    url="require_all_people"
    value="bool"
    defaultValue="false"
/>


### How It Works

When enabled:
- Only photos containing ALL specified people will be displayed
- Photos where only some of the specified people appear will be excluded

### Example Use Cases

1. **Family Photos**:
   - Set multiple person IDs for family members
   - Enable `require_all_people` to only show assets where the whole family is together

2. **Group Events**:
   - Specify IDs for members of a group
   - See only photos where everyone was present

### Important Notes

<Aside type="note">
- This setting only takes effect when multiple people are specified
- If no matching photos are found (where all people appear together), Kiosk will display an error message
- This feature **cannot** be combined with other source/buckets like date ranges or albums
- Setting to `false` returns to default behavior where photos containing ANY of the specified people will be shown

## Excluded People

<Aside type="caution">
    The person or people you want to exclude from the slideshow must be tagged for the exclusion to work.
</Aside>

This feature allows you to prevent specific people from being displayed in the slideshow.

<Settings
    config="excluded_people"
    env="KIOSK_EXCLUDED_PEOPLE"
    url="exclude_person"
    value="[]string"
    defaultValue="[]"
    configOver={`excluded_people:
    - PERSON_ID
    - PERSON_ID
    `}
    envOver={`environment:
    KIOSK_EXCLUDED_PEOPLE: "PERSON_ID, PERSON_ID"
    `}
    urlOver={"http://{URL}?exclude_person=PERSON_ID"}
/>



<Aside type="tip">
    You can remove all excluded people settings (from your `config.yaml` or environment variables) by using `none` in the URL query parameters.

    Example:
    ```http
    https://{URL}?album=ALBUM_ID&exclude_person=none
    ```
</Aside>
