### Video Optimization Recommendations

For optimal playback performance, it's strongly recommended to transcode your videos. This can be configured in Immich:
```
Admin Panel -> System Settings -> Video Transcoding
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- Codec: H264 (for maximum browser compatibility)
- Target Resolution: Select the lowest acceptable resolution for your needs

### How Video Playback Works

1. **Video Selection Process:**
   - When Kiosk selects a video, it first checks if the video is cached.
   - Videos are temporarily stored in the operating system's temp directory.
   - If not cached, the video downloads in the background while another asset is displayed.

2. **Cache Management:**
   - Downloaded videos are queued for display once ready.
   - Cached videos are automatically removed after 10 minutes of inactivity to conserve disk space.
   - Videos are automatically removed when Kiosk shuts down.

3. **Playback Handling:**
   Kiosk will skip to the next asset if any of these conditions occur:
   - Video codec is unsupported by the browser
   - Playback doesn't start within 5 seconds
   - Video playback completes
   - Any playback errors are detected

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your videos are transcoded to H264 format.
- Check browser compatibility with your video codecs.
- Verify that `prefetch` is enabled in your configuration.
- Monitor system storage for cached video files.
